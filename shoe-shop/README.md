# Please read me first,it can help you.
  Hello , my friends .Thank you for you to visit my github. This is my first time to create and commit code to github .There may be a lots of
mistakes and something wrong .The reason is that i can not totally understand Github.com .There are too much new concepts,such as commit ,pull request,fork,repository ,default branch and so on .So, when you visit my personal page, you may seen there is simple...
  The Keith-shop is the project i totally do myself from 《锋利的jQuery》 1 months ago.And i take it as my first project on Github.
  There are two page. one is index.html ,another is detail.html ,all of which are use the languages as follows: HTML, CSS and jquery. May be in the detail.html there use a little CSS3,because you should achieve a effect called ROTATE.
  The important is that in the detail.html ,I use lots of plugin of jQuery ,such as jqzoom,thickbox,cookie,etc.
  If you are also get crazy about HOW TO CREATE A WEBSITE.. You can get contact with me .. I'm waiting for you !
  Best wish!
  Keith.
